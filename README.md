# 🌿 Smart Crop Monitoring Framework

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the implementation of **Regenerative AI for Sustainable Agriculture: A Smart Crop Monitoring Framework**, which integrates **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for plant disease detection and **NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)** for field health analysis. The framework combines **IoT data, remote sensing, and edge/cloud AI deployment** to support precision agriculture and empower smallholder farmers.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Real-time plant disease detection using deep learning  
✅ NDVI heatmap generation from Sentinel-2 satellite bands  
✅ Streamlit web application for easy accessibility  
✅ Modular code structure with retraining notebooks  
✅ Compatible with edge devices for offline inference

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-crop-monitoring.git
cd smart-crop-monitoring
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
conda create -n cropapp python=3.9
conda activate cropapp
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4. Run the Streamlit app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## 🔧 Dependencies

Key packages used:

- TensorFlow
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- Pillow
- Rasterio
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

📦 All packages are listed in requirements.txt

## 🗂️ Dataset

This project uses the [PlantVillage dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease) for training the plant disease classification model.

📌 The dataset is not included in this repository due to size.  
📁 After downloading, run the dataset_split_script.py to create train/val folders:

```bash
python dataset_split_script.py
```

For NDVI analysis, download Sentinel-2 bands (B04 - Red, B08 - NIR) from:

- [Copernicus Open Access Hub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/)
- [Sentinel EO Browser](https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/eo-browser/)

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### 🩺 Plant Disease Detection

- Uses a lightweight CNN model trained on PlantVillage data.
- Class mappings are stored in label_map.json.
- The Streamlit app allows users to upload crop leaf images and returns predicted disease.

### 🛰️ NDVI Estimation

- Accepts Sentinel-2 Red and NIR band GeoTIFF images.
- Computes NDVI using the formula:

\[
NDVI = \frac{(NIR - Red)}{(NIR + Red)}
\]

- Visualizes NDVI as a heatmap for crop health monitoring.
